# Smart Shopping

<h1 align="center">Final Project (Front-end) - Post Full-Stack</h1>

## Introduction
Facing the complexity of daily expenses is a common reality. We present Smart Shopping, an integrated platform that simplifies expense management.
Our application offers effective tracking, intuitive categorization, and real-time insight into spending, empowering users to make informed financial decisions and save time on shopping.

## Objective
We simplify users' lives with a single platform to create and manage shopping lists. Smart Shopping offers expense tracking, keeping the budget on track. With an intuitive interface, categorize your expenses and get an instant view of your consumption habits. Save time, gain clarity on monthly expenses, and find the best deals to save money.

## Tool
The choice of Angular 17 and Bootstrap 4 frameworks on the front-end was motivated by the ability for rapid code reuse, accelerating development. Angular offers a robust framework for building complex web applications with reusable components and facilitates making requests, simplifying data integration. Additionally, its agility in implementing screens allows for intuitively creating dynamic interfaces. Bootstrap, known for its responsiveness, ensures a consistent experience on mobile devices. This strategic choice not only speeds up development but also ensures an adaptable and high-quality interface for users on different devices, promoting a positive and consistent experience.
